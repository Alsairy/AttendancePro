# Monolithic Architecture Transformation

## Overview

This document outlines the transformation of the AttendancePro platform from a microservices architecture to a modular monolith, following clean layered architecture principles.

## Architecture Changes

### Before: Microservices Architecture
- 17+ individual microservices
- API Gateway (Ocelot) for routing
- Service-to-service communication
- Distributed deployment complexity

### After: Modular Monolith Architecture
- Single application with clean layered architecture
- Direct method calls instead of HTTP communication
- Simplified deployment and debugging
- Maintained separation of concerns through modules

## Layered Architecture

### 1. Core Layer (Domain)
- **Project**: `AttendancePlatform.Shared.Domain`
- **Purpose**: Domain entities, enums, and interfaces
- **Contents**: User, Tenant, AttendanceRecord, BiometricTemplate entities

### 2. Application Layer
- **Project**: `AttendancePlatform.Application`
- **Purpose**: Business logic interfaces and DTOs
- **Contents**: Service interfaces for all business domains

### 3. EntityFrameworkCore Layer (Infrastructure)
- **Project**: `AttendancePlatform.Shared.Infrastructure`
- **Purpose**: Data access, repositories, and external integrations
- **Contents**: DbContext, repositories, and infrastructure services

### 4. Web API Layer
- **Project**: `AttendancePlatform.Api`
- **Purpose**: RESTful controllers, middleware, and authentication
- **Contents**: Consolidated controllers and service implementations

## Consolidated Services

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT token management
- Active Directory integration (LDAP and Azure AD)
- Role-based access control
- Multi-factor authentication

### Attendance Management
- Multi-modal check-in/check-out (GPS, Face, Beacon, Biometric)
- Geofence validation
- Attendance history and reporting
- Real-time tracking

### Leave Management
- Leave request workflows
- Approval processes
- Balance tracking
- Calendar integration

### Face Recognition & Biometrics
- Biometric template enrollment
- Face verification and identification
- Liveness detection
- Device integration

### User Management
- User lifecycle management
- Profile management
- Role assignment
- Manager hierarchy

### Active Directory Integration
- User and group synchronization
- Organizational unit management
- Authentication delegation
- Group membership management

## Key Features Preserved

### Multi-Tenancy
- Tenant-aware data isolation
- Configurable tenant settings
- Scalable tenant management

### Security & Access Control
- JWT authentication
- Role-based authorization
- API endpoint protection
- Audit logging

### Biometric Device Integration
- USB fingerprint scanners
- Network-connected terminals
- SDK/API integration
- Log file ingestion

### Active Directory Support
- LDAP (on-premises AD)
- Azure AD (OAuth2/OpenID Connect)
- Group-to-role mapping
- Automatic synchronization

## Technology Stack

### Backend (.NET 8)
- ASP.NET Core Web API
- Entity Framework Core
- PostgreSQL database
- Redis caching
- Serilog logging

### Frontend (React)
- React web application
- TypeScript
- Material-UI components
- Redux state management

### Mobile (React Native)
- Cross-platform iOS/Android
- Biometric authentication
- GPS tracking
- Offline capabilities

## Deployment Configuration

### Docker Compose
- Single API container
- PostgreSQL database
- Redis cache
- RabbitMQ messaging
- Monitoring stack

### Kubernetes
- Simplified deployment manifests
- Auto-scaling configuration
- Health checks
- Service mesh ready

## Benefits of Monolithic Architecture

### Development Benefits

- Consistent transaction boundaries
- Reduced complexity

### Operational Benefits
- Single deployment unit
- Simplified monitoring
- Reduced network latency
- Easier backup and recovery

### Performance Benefits
- Direct method calls vs HTTP
- Shared database connections
- Reduced serialization overhead
- Better resource utilization

## Migration Considerations

### Data Consistency
- Single database transaction scope
- ACID compliance maintained
- Simplified data integrity

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling through load balancing
- Vertical scaling for increased capacity
- Database optimization focus

### Monitoring
- Centralized logging
- Single application metrics
- Simplified health checks

## Future Considerations

### Modular Boundaries
- Clear module separation maintained
- Potential for future service extraction
- Domain-driven design principles

### Performance Optimization
- Database query optimization
- Caching strategies
- Background job processing

### Scalability Planning
- Load testing and capacity planning
- Database sharding considerations
- Caching layer optimization
